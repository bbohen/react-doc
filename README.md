### :ledger: react-doc

This is an active (but early) WIP, to play around with it right now you would need to...

- `git clone`
- `npm link`
- `react-doc` in a react project with a "src" directory

The goal of this is to easily create/display documentation for a react project. I have been messing with parsing the files but should probably look to something like Babylon in the future. With a few more updates this should be ready to at least be considered an alpha.
